# Inn
#Take Registration application (Task #16), Authentication application (Task #14), Files Upload application (Task #15), Logger application (Task #15) and combine it all together #into one application using cookies and sessions.You should decide what data set in cookies and what in sessions.
#Authenticate user after they were registered successfully.
#Allow only 3 login attempts. If they fails, block user by IP on 15 minutes. Log this fact (log attacker IP-address and email, start and end blocking period)
#Only authenticated users should have access to File upload form and be able to upload files. Log successful upload operation (message format: {date}: {actual filename}
#-{filesize} - {archive name} - {archive filesize})
#Log all errors and exceptions in separate storage.
#Implement 'Remember me' functionality and save authenticated user for 1 week.You should implement this application in OOP and MVC pattern
