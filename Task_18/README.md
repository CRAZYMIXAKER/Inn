# Inn

For Task #17 write PHPDoc comments to all properties and methods (if you didn't do it already). Grab information for all
public properties and methods and show it to the user in user-friendly documentation. You can check Yii API
Documentation as example. Don't use any Documentation tools, but create your own implementation. Your documentation must
have description of each property (name, type, source definition, details) and method (name, return type, source
definition, details) and must have cross-referenced links to each other. Don't change the code of Task #17, but create
research application that will connect to it.
